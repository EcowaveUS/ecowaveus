            The Residential EV Charging Infrastructure Program supports residential electric customers by providing rebates for upgrading home-wiring in their garage or parking area (up to $700 for single family homes, with additional rebates for 2-4 units) and ongoing savings once enrolled in a managed charging program, for example approximately $100 annually through the off peak charging program. Customers living in an environmental justice community or enrolled in the low-income discount rate (R-2) are eligible for additional wiring and charger rebates.
