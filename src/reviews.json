    "description": "I can't say enough good things about our experience with ecoWAVE. When our gas burner left us in the cold literally in the middle of winter, Alejo and his amazing team were our knights in shining armor. They sped up our project so we could get our house warm again, and every step of the way, they were absolute stars.\n\nThe way they communicated with us was top-notch. Our install wasn't the most straightforward, but Alejo and his team went over all the possible options with us, making everything super clear. They were patient, knowledgeable, and made sure we felt comfortable and in the loop at all times.\n\nBut they didn't stop at the heat pump. They also installed an EV charger for us and lent their expertise to a bunch of other electrical projects we had around the house. Their versatility and attention to detail were impressive.\n\nI'd recommend ecoWAVE in a heartbeat to anyone looking to make their home more energy-efficient. Alejo and his crew are not just experts in what they do; they're also incredibly committed to making sure their customers are happy and well taken care of. Big thanks to the ecoWAVE team for going above and beyond for us!",
